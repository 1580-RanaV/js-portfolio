        <p class = "edpara">Embarking on my architectural odyssey, I delved into the realms of creativity and innovation at the prestigious <em>National Institute of Technology, Trichy,</em>from 2015 to 2020. This immersive journey not only sculpted my design acumen but also sculpted a profound comprehension of architectural tenets, sustainable design principles, and the integration of technology in modern architecture. Through collaborative projects and hands-on experiences, I gained insights into urban planning, historic preservation, and the symbiotic relationship between architecture and the environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before crafting architectural marvels, I fortified my academic arsenal at <em>Narayana Institutions in Visakhapatnam,</em>from 2013 to 2015. Here, I sketched the blueprint of my intellect, blending science and mathematics into a harmonious symphony of knowledge. This period of academic rigor not only sharpened my analytica skills but also fostered a deep appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of architecture, where science, art, and engineering converge to create impactful spaces.
            <br>
            <br>
            My artistic voyage commenced at <em>Delhi Public School in Visakhapatnam,</em>where in 2013, the seeds of curiosity and creativity were sown. These early strokes on the canvas of education ignited a passion that continues to shape my vision as an architect. The exposure to diverse cultures, languages, and perspectives during my formative years laid the foundation for a holistic approach to design, rooted in empathy and cultural sensitivity.</p>
